# node addons

**NodeJs Addons** is a repository which shows different JavaScript objects
exported through the v8 api.

If there are any issues which have cost you a lot of time figuring out - or
you want to add some more complexity, then feel free to hack.

## Installation

    npm install node-addons
    
then hope it compiles - our manually do

    cd ./node_modules/node-addons && make build

finally you can use any compiled example with **require**

    var addons = require('node-addons');

    console.log(addons.string.value);
    console.log(addons.string.greet('Bodo'));
